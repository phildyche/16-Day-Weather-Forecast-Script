# 16-Day-Weather-Forecast-Script
This R script fetches historical (1-day) and 16-day weather forecasts for customizable locations using the Open-Meteo API. It compiles daily summaries (e.g., max/min temperature, precipitation, wind speed) and computes Heating and Cooling Degree Days. Results are saved to an Excel workbook with separate sheets for historical and forecast data.
